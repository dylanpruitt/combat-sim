# Python Combat Sim
This project is a HoI 4-inspired combat sim made in Python3. I'd been trying to make a battle sim for a while, and thought this was a good start, so I posted it here.

### How To Run
Download the project files. In `main.py`, edit the `attack_units`/`defender_units` lists to change which units appear in battle. Run `main.py` to start the combat sim.

### Documentation
This project has several doc files explaining sim mechanics below:  
[Combat](/docs/combat.md)  
[Feature Ideas](/docs/future.md)  
[Units](/docs/units.md)
