# Future Ideas
I'm not sure how much I'll work on this, but here are some ideas I have for extra content/mechanics:
- Loading saved state for attacking/defending units from JSON config files
- expanded AI strategies for different units
- commanders (like generals in HoI 4)
  - potentially commander experience (new commander just picks random targets, more experienced ones use smarter tactics)
  - traits like in HoI 4
    - examples: "+0.5 Brute Morale Impact", "+0.2 Foot Soldier Morale", "+1 Ranged Defense", etc.
- walls (like forts in HoI 4, give defensive bonus)
- terrain
### Units
- **Ranged Cavalry**: ranged cavalry unit, treated as cavalry so it attacks much faster than normal ranged units on attack
- **Medic**: can heal units every turn
- **Pikes**: weaker than knights, but get an attack boost and deal extra damage to morale against cavalry
- **Artillery**: deals % damage to units - ex. 3%, so the amount it kills scales with the enemy unit's number
